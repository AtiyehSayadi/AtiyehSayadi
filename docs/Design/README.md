# Design Documentation

This folder contains two sub-folders for presenting information related to software design. The SoftArchitecture folder is for the module guide, and the SoftDetailedDes folder is for displaying the characteristics of the modules. In other words, the first provides an overview of the software, while the second carefully examines the features of each module.
