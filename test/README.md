# Automated tests

In this directory, codes and files related to software testing are stored. Text files representing graphs with a .txt extension, and codes with a .py extension are maintained. The test_cig file is used for system testing, and test_graph is used for unit testing. Additionally, two text files, facebook_combined and disconnected, are used for software testing, respectively for large graphs and disconnected graphs.
