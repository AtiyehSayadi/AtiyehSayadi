\section{Introduction}


Analyzing networks using graph-related concepts has been one of the most interesting areas of study for professionals. Among these concepts, centrality and identifying the most effective members of the network are crucial for some studies. This project attempted to identify the most important nodes in a given graph, represented in the form of a matrix of nodes and relationships, using degree centrality and closeness centrality methods. In fact, the goal is to calculate the centrality measures of each node in the graph using both of the mentioned methods.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
The aim of creating this document is to outline the needs, conditions, goals, and etc. that the project will be designed and developed based on. Moreover, it will help ensure a more purposeful testing and approval process in the future and after implementation.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

This project aims to calculate the importance of a node in a graph using the concepts of centrality degree and closeness centrality. The current graph is directed and unweighted. The goal of this project is not to introduce the best metric but merely to compare these two metrics in the graph.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}


Readers of this document need to have sufficient knowledge about graphs, their properties and types, and network analysis in order to have a better understanding of these texts. Additionally, a high level of computer expertise is not required to understand this document.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

This document follows the structure proposed by \citet{SmithandLai2005}, covering all opportunities, requirements, definitions, etc. So, readers can start by looking at the goal statements and then dive into the theoretical model to fully understand the system.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints. 

\subsection{System Context}


Looking at Figure 1 gives you a basic idea of the system. First, it reads a graph file with a graph. Then, it calculates closeness measures for each node using centrality and closeness definitions, giving two arrays as output for the given graph.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{srspicture}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The matrix should be normalized.
\end{itemize}
\item \ CIG Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the input file
\item Calculating degree and closeness centrality for each node in the graph correctly
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}




\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}
Users of this system should have sufficient familiarity with graphs and network analysis concepts to understand the program's output based on their input, which includes measures of centrality, degree, and proximity for each node. They should also be able to upload different files if needed. Since an interface is not designed for data entry, the user should be able to input the file directly into the program's source code.

\subsection{System Constraints}


This system does not examine weighted or directed graphs. Additionally, it does not encompass all types of centrality calculation methods.

\section{Specific System Description}

Consider having a graph representing a social network. We aim to identify the most central individuals in this network using the concept of centrality. Firstly, the social network needs to be introduced to the system in the form of a graph. In fact, it means that the network graph will be introduced to the system as an input in the form of a matrix. Then, the software calculates the centrality measures, specifically degree centrality and closeness centrality, for each node individually and ultimately computes them for all members of the network.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

We have a graph representing a social network, and we aim to identify the most central individuals in this network using the concept of centrality. In other words, finding the most important members in a network in terms of their connections with other members is the main objective of this project.

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Graph:}  A collection of nodes connected by edges.

\item \textbf{Node:} Members in graphs.
\item \textbf{Edge:} Connections between nodes in graphs.

\item \textbf{Centrality:} Measure used to identify the most important nodes in a network.
\item \textbf{Degree:}  Number of direct connection that each node has.


\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

This project can model any network in which directionality is not significant, in the form of an undirected graph. In this network, it is preferred that there are no isolated nodes, although their presence does not disrupt computations, it increases the complexity of analysis. In fact, all networks with bidirectional communication paths can be modeled by this system.


\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
This project attempts to take a matrix representing the communication graph in a network as input in order to:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{g_degree}:] 
Calculate degree centrality for each node.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{g_closeness}:]
Calculate closeness centrality for each node.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

As previously mentioned, the solution presented in this system is only applicable to networks where the direction of communication between members is not significant, in other words, bidirectional relationships. Additionally, networks where communications do not have varying weights or values can be read as input in this system.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

To simplify the calculations, some assumptions have been made in this software:

\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_directed}:]
The graph is undirected.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_weighted}:]
The length of each edge is equal to 1.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}


The purpose of this project is to calculate centrality and proximity measures in a graph. Therefore, it is necessary to become more familiar with this concept accurately.

{
  Degree centrality looks at
how many connections each node has, and if a node has a lot of connections, it’s
considered more important. To calcute DC for each node we need at first calculate degree of node. Degree of node is the number of edged that are direcly connectod to the node. Since the graph is undirected, the degree of each node is equal to the total number of edges connected to that node(\aref{A_directed}). After that we should divide the result to the number of nodes in the graph -1.

\section{Requirements}

This section delineates the requirements of this project across various sections.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] Degree centrality for all nodes ranges between zero and one.
\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] Degree centrality has been calculated for all nodes.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_VerifyOutput}:] Closeness centrality for all nodes ranges between zero and one.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] Closeness centrality has been calculated for all nodes.


\end{itemize}



\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}
In this section, non-functional requirements of the software are expressed in the form of various criteria.

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} \
The most important criterion for computational software is the accuracy and precision of the calculations. For this reason, all computations performed by this software must be accurate. To ensure this, considering that we know the range of outputs between zero and one, and there are libraries that calculate these values, we can ascertain the correctness of the software's performance.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability}
Another requirement of this software is its usability, which will be confirmed by the users who work with it.
\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} 

The software must be maintainable. Modular design in a way that changes in one module have minimal impact on other modules can fulfill this requirement.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability}
The software must be designed in such a way that it can be executed in different conditions and environments. For example, the code for this software is being developed in a Windows environment, and it should be able to run correctly on Linux as well.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}


In this project, efforts have been made to avoid using weighted and directed graphs because these graph models increase computational complexity. 
\section{Likely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] In this project, it is possible that the programming environment may change.

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:]  The method of defining the matrix in the input file may change from n*2 to n*n.
\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:]  Computations may also be performed on directed graphs.

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] The input file is a text file.
\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] Only two centrality methods, degree centrality and closeness centrality, are used.

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\section{Development Plan}


For software development, first, the input file needs to be standardized and read from the input. Then, two centrality algorithms, degree centrality and closeness centrality, are implemented, and efforts are made to display the output with relying on computations and definitions of other matrices.

\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}


 \textbf{Input matrix:}: as an input we have a matrix[n:2]. It means it has several rows and just two columns.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project. 
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
