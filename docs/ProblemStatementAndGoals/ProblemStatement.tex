\section{Problem Statement}

Calculating how important nodes are in graphs is crucial for understanding how networks work. Metrics like degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality help us find key nodes that are vital for information flow, connections, and influence in a network. This project aims to use the concept of centrality to calculate the main and most important nodes in the given graph.

\subsection{Problem}

In this project, we want to study a given graph using centrality measures, specifically degree centrality and closeness centrality. Centrality in a graph is like a way to figure out which nodes are really important. Degree centrality looks at how many connections each node has, and if a node has a lot of connections, it's considered more important. On the other hand, closeness centrality checks how close a node is to all the other nodes in the graph. It focuses on nodes that are central in terms of reaching other nodes efficiently.

For this project, we start with a graph, and by using algorithms for degree centrality and closeness centrality, we find out how central each node is. Degree centrality highlights nodes with many connections, showing their importance in terms of direct connections. Closeness centrality identifies nodes that are central in terms of efficient communication with other nodes. The project's output provides these centrality measures for each node, helping users understand the importance and connections of each node in the given graph. The main goal is to give valuable information about the structure of the network and pinpoint the most influential nodes.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

Input:

A given graph

\section{Goals}

The project has several goals.The main focus is on implementing centrality measures, specifically degree centrality and closeness centrality algorithms, to calculate the importance of each node in a given graph. Degree centrality highlights nodes with many connections, indicating their importance, while closeness centrality identifies nodes crucial for efficient communication. The project output presents these measures for each node, helping users understand the significance and connections of individual nodes in the graph. The primary aim is to provide insights into the network structure and identify influential nodes.
